    <h2 class="contentheader">Status Update</h2>
    <p class="datecaption">February 18, 2019</p>
    <p>Hey there,</p>
    <p>This is just a quick site reorganization update and report on progress for Cynobroad, our main area of focus right now. Current work is now located in the home section, as that is much more important than these smaller style less important blogs, and random blogs will be here. Everything will still get dropped into the archive after the next post comes out. Exciting work is happening with Cynobroad, with the server and client now completely using a packet-like structure instead of the url scheme, which allows much better maintainability, readability, and expandability. This, along with another backend update, should allow us to bring multiple server connections and multiple channels per server into reality much easier, as well as give us a framework for images and emoji to be added to the message. As always, our testing yielded that Cynobroad uses less than 20 MB of RAM, even with the self-hosting option enabled, making our app lightweight and quick to use. On the frontend side of things, Cynobroad now has notification status indicators in place, allowing users to change from Online, Away, Busy, and Invisible modes. Functionality is currently nonexistent with this, as Cynobroad is currently incapable of sending a desktop notification or allow users to simulate being disconnected from the server without actually disconnecting, but the proof of concept is there and shows we can expand the app functionality using the packet structure. The next few updates of Cynobroad will be fixing issues with disconnection and unexpected server closure, shutting down a server safely, and moving the client code to a separate class to allow multiple client classes to be generated, similar to the server. This will provide the basis for multiple server connections. Stay tuned!</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">Renovating Cynobroad and Trackr</h2>
    <p class="datecaption">February 14, 2019</p>
    <p>While EVE projects are still being put on hold, some ideas from them may be adapted to Trackr and Cynobroad, such as window resizing techniques. This allows our friends using 4K screens or other higher than 1080p resolutions to feel comfortable using our applications. Meanwhile, Trackr's data export feature has been temporarily removed and will be redesigned with something better and more intuitive to use. Live autosaving will likely make it into this new system, along with a better folder structure and in-app buttons to find these exported files, saving you having to dig through your install directory. Trackr will also likely have a small UI redesign, making the expanded version of the app the default launch state, giving more room for functionality and making the functions of Trackr more visible to the user. Cynobroad is currently undergoing the redesign to the new SDBrand, and will see some new features like status indicators, chat history, and user profiles.</p>
    <p>Development on applications is going slowly, but hopefully that pace will increase a bit soon, with our newest member on the team to help out, <a href="https://github.com/Spazzlo">Spazzlo</a>! He will assist with the overall development and plans of SDProductions.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">Planned and Upcoming Work</h2>
    <p class="datecaption">January 31, 2019 (Publish: February 9, 2019)</p>
    <p>Because there was little actual work done between the 14th and the end of January, this post is late by about a week and will just cover what is happening in the future. This post will only cover work and plans from the 14th to the 31st, so everything from the 1st to the 14th of February will be covered in a few days!</p>
    <p>Trackr and Cynobroad will finally get a few theming updates now that the final versions of the SDBrand universal marketing theme have been mostly decided on. Since EVE ExtChat is much more of a side project and very niche, Trackr will become the main flagship for updates to SDBranding. Trackr and Cynobroad's existing code will also be looked at, reviewed, and in certain places redone to be more efficient and cleaner to look at as my skill increases with C#. Comments will also be added! This will make it easier for others to contribute something. Trackr itself, in the review and refactorization, will finally maybe get that data analyzer and graph compiler to make your time management effectiveness visible more easily.</p>
    <p>MultispatialLogistics and other EVE projects are being put on hold currently to focus on our flagship product, Trackr.</p>
    <p>As an even more long term project than Trackr, expected to start in Q2 or Q3 19, and one that will likely not start work any time soon to finish polishing up Trackr and Cynobroad, is Claire, digital assistant brought to you by SDProductions. Claire is almost guaranteed only to be available on Windows due to the current research we have done, as I'd like to use Microsoft's Speech API (which unfortunately, ended support in 2015) for the activation phrase, then use something like Google Cloud Speech Recognition for requests as that will likely have a higher accuracy.</p>
    <p>Q2 or Q3 19 will also likely see the introduction of some sort of SDProductions integrated app manager. Unlike those pesky platforms that require you to spend precious system hardware to install them, and then only to have them get in the way more with notifications, the goal with our app manager is for it to use the same low resource, low power app model and have it run in the background. The app manager will be totally self contained and install SDProductions apps into the same install folder of itself, ensuring easy uninstall that won't leave any files if needed. Plans to integrate it with Claire natively would also be awesome, but since this is far enough into the future everything here is subject to change.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/SDProductions">Check our work out here!</a> Next update in 5 days if no delays.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">Launch of Current Work</h2>
    <p class="datecaption">January 14, 2019</p>
    <p>Today will be the launch of the Current Work tab for this site, which will detail exactly what I've been working on. This was renamed from A Commit A Day (because once I fail to meet that goal, this would die too). This page will recieve bimonthly updates, once on the 14 of the month, and another on the 30/31st of the month, to give an update on what's happening with all SDProductions and SDBrand products. Eventually I'd like to integrate some levels of statistics and pretty graphs, but not now. The last two weeks from the start of 2019 to now have been quite good, and a fair amount of work was accomplished during that period.</p>
    <h3>Multispatial Logistics:</h3>
    <p>Multispatial Logistics, the EVE Online based webservice for players built on ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1, began a total redo mainly because the old project broke for some reason (who knows why). It now uses a localdb SQL database to hold stargate information which means that the site will no longer return an error code because it was taking too long to call ESI several hundred times to get static data. It features a basic frontend and a placeholder for OAuth, which means fun things can be integrated such as using character skills, implants, active ship, fatigue information, location and destination data, and more to provide a better experience. Right now, the backend is about 50% of where I'd like it to be - ship database information still needs to be added, along with some related calculations regarding align times and such which would provide more accuracy towards time calculations. The frontend is practically nonexistent save for a basic form element and SSO button, so that definitely needs to be improved upon as well. I have some ideas for what I want the frontend to look like, but unfortunately no time to properly sketch them out to further polish and implement the ideas.</p>
    <h3>SDProductions Official Website</h3>
    <p>The SDProductions website has also been redesigned to feature a cleaner, more smooth browsing experience and be more concise and clear in its delivery of information. It has been changed from the previous one-page experience to a tabbed single-page no-scroll site, which I think looks cleaner. It has been modified (not using fluid grids or anything) to look decent on mobile screens and 2:3 screens, but currently has not been tested on ultrawide screens and if anything, probably breaks.</p>
    <h3>EVE ExtChat</h3>
    <p>EVE ExtChat, a side project to Multispatial Logistics, is a Win32 based tool meant for use alongside the EVE Online client. It is 100% EULA and TOS compliant, as it only reads from log files the game outputs and never interacts with the game directly. The idea and purpose of ExtChat is to provide an enhanced experience with EVE's chat system, bringing EVE's chat more inline with features expected from a modern chat platform such as Discord. Planned features include notification sounds whenever your character or an alt character's name gets mentioned in a channel, with Do Not Disturb modes available, localized intelligence alerts for enemy hostiles reported in in-game intel channels, and customizable alerts related to in-game chat. It is the first Win32 app by SDProductions to use the latest SDBrand theming consistency. However, as it is a side project, it will likely see much less attention than other ones at the moment.</p>
    <h3>SDBranding & You</h3>
    <p>The SDProductions theme has been universalized into one single theming style, SDBrand! SDBrand will be integrated into all SDProductions products in the near future, and will come on our apps such as Trackr, Cynobroad, and ExtChat. SDBrand will also be found on all of our websites soon, including this one, which will come into a redesign in the near future when I have some time. The basic SDBrand theming style can be found on the wiki of the SDProductions GitHub Pages site repo.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>SDBrand is here, EVE stuff is getting worked on, and websites are being redesigned along with existing SDProductions products. Exciting! That's about it for these two weeks. Check back in another two to see what great things have been bestowed upon you!</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">January 10th, 2019</h2>
    <p>I'm back from semester 1 finals (which I did well on, thankfully) and am working on some brand new exciting stuff and planning revamps to older projects to bring them in-line with a master theming plan for SDBrand as a whole.</p>
    <p>Before we get into projects, check out the redesigned <a href="https://sdproductions.github.io">SDProductions website</a>! This website showcases parts of what I want to bring to brand consistency to SDProductions and also the main projects I'm working on.</p>
    <p>The main thing I've been working on this month is <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/MultispatialLogistics">Multispatial Logistics</a>, an ASP.NET Core 2.1 webapp built around providing services for MMORPG EVE Online. It's in it's early stages, but decent progress has been made and something resembling a prototype of a backend has been implemented, so go check it out! Details will come when the site is publically hosted.</p>
    <p>Besides that, new project <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/EVE-ExtChat">EVE ExtChat</a> is being introduced as an EVE Online chat extension tool that is fully EULA/TOS compliant and will enhance the player's in-game experience with chat, providing features such as @mention sounds when your character name is linked in game, and providing live intel updates from intel channels in-game. Other features being considered are connecting directly to other corporation member clients to provide some other level of feature capability, although this may never happen. It is the first SDBrand app planned to use the overhauled consistent theming of SDProductions.</p>
    <p>However, not everything is EVE Online related. Upgrades are planned for both Trackr and Cynobroad to use SDBrand consistent theming as well as potentially some new animation and interface overhaul to make using them a much better experience and less like using your grandma's old DOS PC. In addition, the A Commit A Day project will be live on this site soon, documenting how long I can keep up with one commit or more per day in 2019. Weekly summaries will be posted as well as monthly statistics on commits, scheduling permit. Check back later, and be hyped!</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">October 31st, 2018</h2>
    <p>Happy spoopy day of 2018!</p>
    <p>This is just a quick update to show what I've been working on over the past month and a bit. Most notably, the <a= href="https://sdproductions.github.io">SDProductions GitHub Pages site</a> is up! Definitely still a work in progress but at least it is there. There have been mostly minor updates to Trackr as well. Two new projects join the roster, but not under the SDProductions name, <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/ByteTile">ByteTile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/Mandelbrot-Plotter">Mandelbrot Plotter</a>. Maybe go take a look! They're fairly niche though which is why they aren't under SDProductions. Other than that, not too much has been happening.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">September 9th, 2018</h2>
    <p>Behold, the <a href="static/modulusfieldchecker.py">Modulus Field Checker</a>! This Python 3.x script will take an integer input and check if that mod set is a field under the 11 axioms of multiplication and addition. It features no exception handling whatsoever, so try not to screw up your inputs. This was created to not have to bother writing out 11 axiom checks for each of 4 modulus tables we had to create, because my fragile hands can't take writing out more than six letters at a time. Of course, my algebra teacher hasn't specifically said we could show our work this way, but I believe this adequately demonstrates my knowledge about the concept at hand and how I can apply it elsewhere. The script was verified using existing knowledge about modular operations.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">August 20th, 2018</h2>
    <p>School has started for me! Hurrah! Hurrah!</p>
    <p>Yeah, as if I'd particularly be excited about that. Expect very infrequent updates and little to no work done at all in the coming months. Sorry.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">August 4th, 2018</h2>
    <p>Took a look at Universal Windows Platform and Windows Presentation Foundation application templates in Visual Studio, and while I guess it is the more modern and better equipped version to Windows Forms, I still prefer working with Forms as both other alternatives seem like not quite the thing I need to acheive what I'm doing with Forms. Regretting past decisions? A little, but you gotta maintain that old school cool.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">August 2nd, 2018</h2>
    <p>Trackr, our off-brand time tracking and management application, now has a HOT NEW LOOK. According to Discord, HOT NEW LOOKS are all the rage right now and we want to jump on that bandwagon as soon as possible because we too like HOT NEW LOOKS. It makes everything look way more modern and less cramped. <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">Check it out!</a></p>
    <p>Speaking of Trackr, it is currently in a 2 week beta testing period where stuff will probably change as I realize exactly how terrible my code is. If you'd like to help, you can do so by cloning the repo & building the project in Visual Studio, then taking that built Debug folder and moving it to your location of choice. This ensures that 1) I am not feeding you a fake version of the project not built from the source code on GitHub, so you can see exactly what gets accessed, and 2) You can do stuff with the code and make your own fork!</p>
    <p>Our other on-going project (sorry Digi-Physical Item Manager, you were an okay idea that I lost interest in), Cynobroad, also has had an update a few days ago which adds nicer looking homemade rich message blocks. While this doesn't add a lot of customizability to your messages that you send, it does allow us to fiddle around and give each message it's own special metadata (as well as looking nicer), which should allow us to do some cool stuff like user profile pictures, editing messages, and other things.</p>
    <p>Third and finally, SDProductions will be getting it's own proper website! 'Formal' (as if I ever did formal) update notes and changelogs as well as projects and the bulk of the promotional material will reside there once I've got a framework for it. This website will become more of a general 'look at what's happening behind the scenes' kind of thing and where you can reach me personally rather than the 'company'. As a result the Projects tab has been removed from this site.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">July 8th, 2018</h2>
    <p>Quick update here -</p>
    <p>After working offline tinkering about with the to-be-renamed Cynobroad chat program, I feel like it's at a point where it reaches a few requirements of mine to be published: A) It isn't entirely made up of code from StackOverflow, and B) it at least somewhat doesn't resemble a moist pile of non-working electronic waste. The GitHub repo is available <a href="https://www.github.com/SDProductions/Cynobroad">here</a>. Here's the rundown about what the program's gone through development-wise so far.</p>
    <p>Originally, I intended it to use UDP - it's quick and easy to work with, and suits my needs as I had planned to distribute this software to friends to use on a local network, thereby not requiring a server. Heh.. yeah, unfortunately not. Although, now I can confirm all the jokes on UDP are true. I'd tell you some, but I don't think you'd get them.</p>
    <p>This, of course, left TCP as one of my main options. From what I'd seen, TCP was a right pain to work with compared to UDP, although I did locate a few helpful sources that greatly simplified the information I needed to know. Since all I really needed was a small decentralized thing that could run anywhere, using a TCP client/server relationship seemed a little overkill, but I went with it anyway as it seemed useful and worthwhile enough to spend the time to learn how to implement it.</p>
    <p>And that's where the program stands today. It's still a very very early stages sort of thing, with a basically non-functional UI apart from the chat system, and there's no way to distinguish who's who and who said what. Despite this, since the main difficult bit is out of the way (Networking is hard, okay?), more regular updates will be following.</p>
    <p>That's it, see you next time.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">July 4th, 2018</h2>
    <p>Happy fourth of July, fellow Americans! SDProductions has two announcements, one for a new peice of off-brand kit to add to your digitalized collection, and another for our plush-merchant roadmap! That's right, now you can feel even better as you eat your hot dogs and your hopefully-not-overcooked steaks. Nothing is worse than an overcooked steak.</p>
    <p>So you're probably wondering - "What do you have for us now, glorious off-brand overlords SDProductions?" Well, glad you asked! Introducing <b>Cynobroad</b>, our alternative to the growing competing market that is the chat service. We saw that Discord had taken off massively within the cyberspace, Steam was doing a blatant ripoff of Discord in their new beta (Sorry Steam, but it was too obvious), and services like Slack also doing quite well. So, we decided to make our own crappy off-brand of these services!</p>
    <p>Cynobroad is still within testing and basic design phases at the moment - which means code copied from StackOverflow and buggy and unusable things both in the code and out. We're just taking a look at what we'd like our program to do that the other services don't offer and I personally am learning the concepts behind this, like the networking bits and how that all fits together. For a chat service, that's pretty important. As a result, <b>Cynobroad will not see a GitHub repository for a to be determined amount of time</b>. It may also under go some rebranding, so keep an eye out!</p>
    <p>Our second announcement is our roadmap for our software. We do have a plan for it, and we'd like to let you know what it is.</p>
    <p>Currently, our main thing we've been working on is Trackr, our off-brand time-management solution, and now we are transitioning to mainly work on Cynobroad. After about 3-4 of these little apps get released, we'd like to start work upon an app overlay including these apps and some other features. While we don't know exactly what we'd like of the overlay, we do know it should fit the theme of our programs, have a sleek and unobstructive design, and be able to support future third-party expandability, be that programs or an in-built editor. Overall, as we progress to this things may get redesigns and rebrands to further enforce a clean integration with eachother.</p>
    <p>That's it for today! Have fun out there with your BBQ and stuff.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="contentheader">June 30th, 2018</h2>
    <p>We (singular) here at SDProductions are pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">Trackr</a>, our off-brand time management application and helper, has entered the beta stages of development! If you haven't seen it, you should take a look.</p>
    <p>While other similar services require you to sign up and sync data to their web-app equivalent, Trackr's desktop client never connects to any first, second, third, or fourth party servers. Or any, in fact. This means that you can be rest assured that whatever you put in never gets seen by anyone that doesn't have access to your computer. Great, right?</p>
    <p>But wait, you ask. Even if Trackr never connects to any server, it can still have the potential to screw with my computer locally, right? First of all, I feel very offended you even thought that my software would be malware. And second, I'll tell you exactly what Trackr accesses from your system!</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Trackr can access the following:</b></p>
    <p>Your system's time and date</p>
    <p>File data <b>within</b> Trackr's folders</p>
    <br>
    <p>And that's it! It doesn't screw with anything else. Not convinced? The source code is all available on <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">the project's GitHub page.</a></p>
    <p>Besides Trackr, you might have noticed my inactivity lately. I guarantee you this is all because of the Steam summer sale and not because of pure laziness and lack of will to work on anything. I should be back working on stuff as time permits soon.</p>
