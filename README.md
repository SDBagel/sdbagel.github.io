# sdbagel.github.io
The premium site for all your fresh bagels, bagels not included.
Here, you can keep up with what I'm currently doing, what I've done in the past, and other similarly cool stuff.

This was my very first website, ever! Pretty cool. Also why it looks terrible and has the grammar of a 4-year-old. I still have the grammar skills of a 4-year-old. Currently, undergoing a redesign under the neo-sdbrand branch of this repo, so stay put.

Since I'm not following any particular standard, the organization and methods I use are probably terrible. Each page on the site has its own HTML file, sharing the same base header and navigation bar. There is one 'main' CSS file, which applies to every file for the base of the page. The 404 page has it's own dedicated CSS file. If needed, each page might also have its own CSS file, named the same as the page. This is for page-specific elements that need additional CSS. The static folder hosts all the media and other things on the site that are unlikely to change, if ever. This includes video files (which I do make an effort to keep under 10MB each, as GitHub has a soft 1GB repo limit and 100GB bandwidth per month for a GitHub Page).

Otherwise, most of the other stuff should be pretty self-explanatory.
