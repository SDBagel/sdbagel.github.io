    <h2 id="contentheader">Hey There!</h2>
    <p>I'm Kyle, a developer working as a freelancer on both personal and commissioned projects (for very reasonable rates, too!). While I'm not particularly good at any programming language (what do you expect of me anyway?), I'd say I know my way around C#, Windows Forms, and the .NET Framework well (as in not-a-total-noob), as well as some Python. I'm taking a look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development, mainly on this here website!</p>
    <p>On this website you can find out what I'm up to and what you can expect to come in the future regarding the things I make. On your right, you can see some of the featured items I have. Some really cool stuff, if you ask me! On top, you can see various tabs for learning more about what I do, projects I've done, and how you can contact me. The design goal of this website is to make all information on it as easily accessible as possible. If you have any ideas for improvements, do let me know! Feedback is always appreciated on all of my projects (except the ones that I say otherwise on, because they're more pet projects than things I'd like to release).</p>
    <p>That's probably it for now. I plan to update this place at least somewhat regularly, as my time permits, so check back for new stuff to look at! I'd say often, but I don't think I'd dedicate <i>that</i> much time to this place.</p>
