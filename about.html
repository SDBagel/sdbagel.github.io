    <p>I'm Kyle, a developer working as a freelancer on both personal and commissioned projects (for very reasonable rates, too!). While I'm not particularly good at any programming language (what do you expect of me anyway?), I'd say I know my way around C#, Windows Forms, and the .NET Framework well (as in not-a-total-noob), as well as some Python. I'm taking a look at ASP.NET Core MVC for web development over at <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/MultispatialLogistics">Multispatial Logistics</a>, the web presence for the EVE Online corporation I run! This website is just a do-it-from-scratch look at things.</p>
    <p>On this website you can find out what I'm up to and what you can expect to come in the future regarding the things I make. On your right at the homepage, you can see some of the featured items I have. Some really cool stuff, if you ask me! On top, you can see various tabs for learning more about what I do, projects I've done, and how you can contact me. The design goal of this website is to make all information on it as easily accessible as possible. If you have any ideas for improvements, do let me know! Feedback is always appreciated on all of my projects (except the ones that I say otherwise on, because they're more pet projects than things I'd like to release).</p>
    <p>I am a student at the moment which means very little will get done as school takes priority.</p>
