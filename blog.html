    <p>Hey there,</p>
    <p>This is just a quick site reorganization update and report on progress for Cynobroad, our main area of focus right now. Current work is now located in the home section, as that is much more important than these smaller style less important blogs, and random blogs will be here. Everything will still get dropped into the archive after the next post comes out. Exciting work is happening with Cynobroad, with the server and client now completely using a packet-like structure instead of the url scheme, which allows much better maintainability, readability, and expandability. This, along with another backend update, should allow us to bring multiple server connections and multiple channels per server into reality much easier, as well as give us a framework for images and emoji to be added to the message. As always, our testing yielded that Cynobroad uses less than 20 MB of RAM, even with the self-hosting option enabled, making our app lightweight and quick to use. On the frontend side of things, Cynobroad now has notification status indicators in place, allowing users to change from Online, Away, Busy, and Invisible modes. Functionality is currently nonexistent with this, as Cynobroad is currently incapable of sending a desktop notification or allow users to simulate being disconnected from the server without actually disconnecting, but the proof of concept is there and shows we can expand the app functionality using the packet structure. The next few updates of Cynobroad will be fixing issues with disconnection and unexpected server closure, shutting down a server safely, and moving the client code to a separate class to allow multiple client classes to be generated, similar to the server. This will provide the basis for multiple server connections. Stay tuned!</p>
