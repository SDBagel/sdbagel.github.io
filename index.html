    <p>Yes! This website isn't totally dead, surprisingly. It will recieve some updates to look nicer, using techniques and other tidbits I've learned. This was actually my first website, which is pretty cool, and it's exciting to finally be able to give it that neo-SDBrand look it needs, as well as make everything scale much nicer. Stay tuned!</p>
