    <p>I'm back from semester 1 finals (which I did well on, thankfully) and am working on some brand new exciting stuff and planning revamps to older projects to bring them in-line with a master theming plan for SDBrand as a whole.</p>
    <p>Before we get into projects, check out the redesigned <a href="https://sdproductions.github.io">SDProductions website</a>! This website showcases parts of what I want to bring to brand consistency to SDProductions and also the main projects I'm working on.</p>
    <p>The main thing I've been working on this month is <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/MultispatialLogistics">Multispatial Logistics</a>, an ASP.NET Core 2.1 webapp built around providing services for MMORPG EVE Online. It's in it's early stages, but decent progress has been made and something resembling a prototype of a backend has been implemented, so go check it out! Details will come when the site is publically hosted.</p>
    <p>Besides that, new project <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/EVE-ExtChat">EVE ExtChat</a> is being introduced as an EVE Online chat extension tool that is fully EULA/TOS compliant and will enhance the player's in-game experience with chat, providing features such as @mention sounds when your character name is linked in game, and providing live intel updates from intel channels in-game. Other features being considered are connecting directly to other corporation member clients to provide some other level of feature capability, although this may never happen. It is the first SDBrand app planned to use the overhauled consistent theming of SDProductions.</p>
    <p>However, not everything is EVE Online related. Upgrades are planned for both Trackr and Cynobroad to use SDBrand consistent theming as well as potentially some new animation and interface overhaul to make using them a much better experience and less like using your grandma's old DOS PC. In addition, the A Commit A Day project will be live on this site soon, documenting how long I can keep up with one commit or more per day in 2019. Weekly summaries will be posted as well as monthly statistics on commits, scheduling permit. Check back later, and be hyped!</p>
