    <h2 class="contentheader">Renovating Cynobroad and Trackr</h2>
    <p class="datecaption">February 14, 2019</p>
    <p>While EVE projects are still being put on hold, some ideas from them may be adapted to Trackr and Cynobroad, such as window resizing techniques. This allows our friends using 4K screens or other higher than 1080p resolutions to feel comfortable using our applications. Meanwhile, Trackr's data export feature has been temporarily removed and will be redesigned with something better and more intuitive to use. Live autosaving will likely make it into this new system, along with a better folder structure and in-app buttons to find these exported files, saving you having to dig through your install directory. Trackr will also likely have a small UI redesign, making the expanded version of the app the default launch state, giving more room for functionality and making the functions of Trackr more visible to the user. Cynobroad is currently undergoing the redesign to the new SDBrand, and will see some new features like status indicators, chat history, and user profiles.</p>
    <p>Development on applications is going slowly, but hopefully that pace will increase a bit soon, with our newest member on the team to help out, <a href="https://github.com/Spazzlo">Spazzlo</a>! He will assist with the overall development and plans of SDProductions.</p>
