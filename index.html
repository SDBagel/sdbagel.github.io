      <p>Hi there! I'm Kyle, a current highschool student screwing around programming for fun and as a career option. I take interest in web and desktop development, sometimes including IoT and cloud technologies. My language of choice is C#, but I am also capable of writing basic Python, JavaScript and C++ as needed, and am familiar enough with concepts that I can just look up whatever I don't know. I'm constantly learning, and looking to have fun making software!</p>

      <p>Have an idea for a site or app, but don't know how to bring it to life? I accept small ideas or requests and will slap them together for you for a reasonable fee. This fee depends on the scope of the project, and I will deny anything that I can't reasonably accomplish within 2 weeks of work. If you'd like to get in touch, you can find my contact info on the left.</p>
