    <p>Happy spoopy day of 2018!</p>
    <p>This is just a quick update to show what I've been working on over the past month and a bit. Most notably, the <a= href="https://sdproductions.github.io">SDProductions GitHub Pages site</a> is up! Definitely still a work in progress but at least it is there. There have been mostly minor updates to Trackr as well. Two new projects join the roster, but not under the SDProductions name, <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/ByteTile">ByteTile</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SDBagel/Mandelbrot-Plotter">Mandelbrot Plotter</a>. Maybe go take a look! They're fairly niche though which is why they aren't under SDProductions. Other than that, not too much has been happening.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">September 9th, 2018</h2>
    <p>Behold, the <a href="static/modulusfieldchecker.py">Modulus Field Checker</a>! This Python 3.x script will take an integer input and check if that mod set is a field under the 11 axioms of multiplication and addition. It features no exception handling whatsoever, so try not to screw up your inputs. This was created to not have to bother writing out 11 axiom checks for each of 4 modulus tables we had to create, because my fragile hands can't take writing out more than six letters at a time. Of course, my algebra teacher hasn't specifically said we could show our work this way, but I believe this adequately demonstrates my knowledge about the concept at hand and how I can apply it elsewhere. The script was verified using existing knowledge about modular operations.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">August 20th, 2018</h2>
    <p>School has started for me! Hurrah! Hurrah!</p>
    <p>Yeah, as if I'd particularly be excited about that. Expect very infrequent updates and little to no work done at all in the coming months. Sorry.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">August 4th, 2018</h2>
    <p>Took a look at Universal Windows Platform and Windows Presentation Foundation application templates in Visual Studio, and while I guess it is the more modern and better equipped version to Windows Forms, I still prefer working with Forms as both other alternatives seem like not quite the thing I need to acheive what I'm doing with Forms. Regretting past decisions? A little, but you gotta maintain that old school cool.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">August 2nd, 2018</h2>
    <p>Trackr, our off-brand time tracking and management application, now has a HOT NEW LOOK. According to Discord, HOT NEW LOOKS are all the rage right now and we want to jump on that bandwagon as soon as possible because we too like HOT NEW LOOKS. It makes everything look way more modern and less cramped. <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">Check it out!</a></p>
    <p>Speaking of Trackr, it is currently in a 2 week beta testing period where stuff will probably change as I realize exactly how terrible my code is. If you'd like to help, you can do so by cloning the repo & building the project in Visual Studio, then taking that built Debug folder and moving it to your location of choice. This ensures that 1) I am not feeding you a fake version of the project not built from the source code on GitHub, so you can see exactly what gets accessed, and 2) You can do stuff with the code and make your own fork!</p>
    <p>Our other on-going project (sorry Digi-Physical Item Manager, you were an okay idea that I lost interest in), Cynobroad, also has had an update a few days ago which adds nicer looking homemade rich message blocks. While this doesn't add a lot of customizability to your messages that you send, it does allow us to fiddle around and give each message it's own special metadata (as well as looking nicer), which should allow us to do some cool stuff like user profile pictures, editing messages, and other things.</p>
    <p>Third and finally, SDProductions will be getting it's own proper website! 'Formal' (as if I ever did formal) update notes and changelogs as well as projects and the bulk of the promotional material will reside there once I've got a framework for it. This website will become more of a general 'look at what's happening behind the scenes' kind of thing and where you can reach me personally rather than the 'company'. As a result the Projects tab has been removed from this site.</p>

    <p>Quick update here -</p>
    <p>After working offline tinkering about with the to-be-renamed Cynobroad chat program, I feel like it's at a point where it reaches a few requirements of mine to be published: A) It isn't entirely made up of code from StackOverflow, and B) it at least somewhat doesn't resemble a moist pile of non-working electronic waste. The GitHub repo is available <a href="https://www.github.com/SDProductions/Cynobroad">here</a>. Here's the rundown about what the program's gone through development-wise so far.</p>
    <p>Originally, I intended it to use UDP - it's quick and easy to work with, and suits my needs as I had planned to distribute this software to friends to use on a local network, thereby not requiring a server. Heh.. yeah, unfortunately not. Although, now I can confirm all the jokes on UDP are true. I'd tell you some, but I don't think you'd get them.</p>
    <p>This, of course, left TCP as one of my main options. From what I'd seen, TCP was a right pain to work with compared to UDP, although I did locate a few helpful sources that greatly simplified the information I needed to know. Since all I really needed was a small decentralized thing that could run anywhere, using a TCP client/server relationship seemed a little overkill, but I went with it anyway as it seemed useful and worthwhile enough to spend the time to learn how to implement it.</p>
    <p>And that's where the program stands today. It's still a very very early stages sort of thing, with a basically non-functional UI apart from the chat system, and there's no way to distinguish who's who and who said what. Despite this, since the main difficult bit is out of the way (Networking is hard, okay?), more regular updates will be following.</p>
    <p>That's it, see you next time.</p>
    <h2 class="contentheader">July 4th, 2018</h2>
    <p>Happy fourth of July, fellow Americans! SDProductions has two announcements, one for a new peice of off-brand kit to add to your digitalized collection, and another for our plush-merchant roadmap! That's right, now you can feel even better as you eat your hot dogs and your hopefully-not-overcooked steaks. Nothing is worse than an overcooked steak.</p>
    <p>So you're probably wondering - "What do you have for us now, glorious off-brand overlords SDProductions?" Well, glad you asked! Introducing <b>Cynobroad</b>, our alternative to the growing competing market that is the chat service. We saw that Discord had taken off massively within the cyberspace, Steam was doing a blatant ripoff of Discord in their new beta (Sorry Steam, but it was too obvious), and services like Slack also doing quite well. So, we decided to make our own crappy off-brand of these services!</p>
    <p>Cynobroad is still within testing and basic design phases at the moment - which means code copied from StackOverflow and buggy and unusable things both in the code and out. We're just taking a look at what we'd like our program to do that the other services don't offer and I personally am learning the concepts behind this, like the networking bits and how that all fits together. For a chat service, that's pretty important. As a result, <b>Cynobroad will not see a GitHub repository for a to be determined amount of time</b>. It may also under go some rebranding, so keep an eye out!</p>
    <p>Our second announcement is our roadmap for our software. We do have a plan for it, and we'd like to let you know what it is.</p>
    <p>Currently, our main thing we've been working on is Trackr, our off-brand time-management solution, and now we are transitioning to mainly work on Cynobroad. After about 3-4 of these little apps get released, we'd like to start work upon an app overlay including these apps and some other features. While we don't know exactly what we'd like of the overlay, we do know it should fit the theme of our programs, have a sleek and unobstructive design, and be able to support future third-party expandability, be that programs or an in-built editor. Overall, as we progress to this things may get redesigns and rebrands to further enforce a clean integration with eachother.</p>
    <p>That's it for today! Have fun out there with your BBQ and stuff.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="contentheader">June 30th, 2018</h2>
    <p>We (singular) here at SDProductions are pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">Trackr</a>, our off-brand time management application and helper, has entered the beta stages of development! If you haven't seen it, you should take a look.</p>
    <p>While other similar services require you to sign up and sync data to their web-app equivalent, Trackr's desktop client never connects to any first, second, third, or fourth party servers. Or any, in fact. This means that you can be rest assured that whatever you put in never gets seen by anyone that doesn't have access to your computer. Great, right?</p>
    <p>But wait, you ask. Even if Trackr never connects to any server, it can still have the potential to screw with my computer locally, right? First of all, I feel very offended you even thought that my software would be malware. And second, I'll tell you exactly what Trackr accesses from your system!</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Trackr can access the following:</b></p>
    <p>Your system's time and date</p>
    <p>File data <b>within</b> Trackr's folders</p>
    <br>
    <p>And that's it! It doesn't screw with anything else. Not convinced? The source code is all available on <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">the project's GitHub page.</a></p>
    <p>Besides Trackr, you might have noticed my inactivity lately. I guarantee you this is all because of the Steam summer sale and not because of pure laziness and lack of will to work on anything. I should be back working on stuff as time permits soon.</p>
