    <h2 id="contentheader">Recent News - June 30th, 2018</h2>
    <p>We (singular) here at SDProductions are pleased to announce that <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">Trackr</a>, our off-brand time management application and helper, has entered the beta stages of development! If you haven't seen it, you should take a look.</p>
    <p>While other similar services require you to sign up and sync data to their web-app equivalent, Trackr's desktop client never connects to any first, second, third, or fourth party servers. Or any, in fact. This means that you can be rest assured that whatever you put in never gets seen by anyone that doesn't have access to your computer. Great, right?</p>
    <p>But wait, you ask. Even if Trackr never connects to any server, it can still have the potential to screw with my computer locally, right? First of all, I feel very offended you even thought that my software would be malware. And second, I'll tell you exactly what Trackr accesses from your system!</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Trackr can access the following:</b></p>
    <p>Your system's time and date</p>
    <p>File data <b>within</b> Trackr's folders</p>
    <br>
    <p>And that's it! It doesn't screw with anything else. Not convinced? The source code is all available on <a href="https://github.com/SDProductions/Trackr">the project's GitHub page.</a></p>
    <p>Besides Trackr, you might have noticed my inactivity lately. I guarantee you this is all because of the Steam summer sale and not because of pure laziness and lack of will to work on anything. I should be back working on stuff as time permits soon.</p>
